  <div id="article_text">
    <p>I was born in Madrid in 1987, and moved to a smaller city called
Salamanca soon after. There I grew up, and studied the first three
years of my Physics degree at the
<a href="http://www.usal.es/webusal/en">University of Salamanca</a>. I then moved back
to Madrid to take the specialization in Astrophysics at the
<a href="https://www.ucm.es/english">Complutense University</a>.  I got my degree
in Physics in early 2011, and at the time I was quite doubtful about
what to do next. Luckily for me, I discovered the
<a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=ESACTRAINEES&amp;page=index"><span class="caps">ESA</span> trainee program</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=ESACTRAINEES&amp;page=index">European Space Astronomy Centre (<span class="caps">ESAC</span>)</a>
just in time. I got
involved in a 6 month project to study star-forming regions with  data from the
<a href="http://sci.esa.int/herschel/"><em>Herschel</em> Space Observatory</a>. This was
my very first contact with &#8220;real&#8221; research , and it gave me a great
opportunity to work with state-of-the-art data and in an
international environment, and a global idea of how science
works. I loved it. After my traineeship, I got my master in Astrophysics (2011/2012) with a combined
program at <a href="https://www.ucm.es/english">Complutense University</a> and
<a href="https://www.uam.es/ss/Satellite/en/home.htm">Autonoma University</a>. At
the same time, I joined the
<a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/home">Herschel Science Center</a>
for one year as a astronomer tester for <a href="http://herschel.esac.esa.int/hipe/"><span class="caps">HIPE</span></a> (the Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment), the software used to process and analyze
<em>Herschel</em>&nbsp;data. </p>
<p>From late 2012 until today, I am a PhD student at <span class="caps">ESAC</span> under the
supervision of <a href="http://brunomerin.com/">Bruno Merín</a> and
<a href="http://www.cab.inta-csic.es/users/hbouy/">Hervé Bouy</a>, and funded by
<a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA"><span class="caps">ESA</span></a> . My research focuses on the
characteristics and evolution of protoplanetary disks around young
stars, to better understand how planets and planetary systems form and&nbsp;evolve.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have been passionate about literature, music and cinema since I was
a child, and got later interested in
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/desilusionista/">photography</a> too. I
also write short stories, and have been very lucky to get some
published in different contests. I have been doing outreach since I
started my degree, either by directly talking to people or through my
<a href="http://cartasdesdeandromeda.blogspot.com.es/">blog</a> (in Spanish). I really enjoy traveling and discovering
other cultures, something that my job involves quite often (luckily
me!). Also sports have always been a vital part of my life, from basketball
to fencing, rock climbing or scuba diving. And although I don&#8217;t have
enough time for everything, I am really interested in
other fields such as Philosophy and Biology. And of course, I would
love to have more time for all these&nbsp;things!</p>
