    <p>My research focusses on the disks of gas and dust that surround newborn stars. Planets form in these disks, and
their characteristics are crucial to understand the huge diversity of planets that we are just starting to
unveil. By studying these disks at different wavelengths and comparing them with physical models, we can learn
about their structure, evolution, and their connection with planetary formation.  You can find a summary of some of
my research&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>My research interests include protoplanetary and debris disks, exoplanets, and planet formation. I am also a huge
fan of Python, and am also interested in Bayesian statistics, data mining and visualization, and machine&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>The evolution of protoplanetary disks in the solar&nbsp;neighborhood</h2>
<p>The evolution of protoplanetary disks determines the properties and fates of future planetary systems. However,
these disks live for millions of years, and waiting that long is not practical. Instead, we look at different young
star-forming regions across the sky with different ages. By looking at the fraction of disks as a function of age,
we can infer how they&nbsp;evolve.</p>
<table class="image" style="width:50%; float:left; margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;" > <caption
align="bottom" style="font-size:14pt; font-style: italic"">Disk dispersal as a function of time. Each dot is the
disk fraction in a given star-forming region. The red line shows the overall evolution (Ribas et
al. 2014).</caption> <tr><td><img src="../images/disk_evolution.png" width = 100% /></td></tr> </table>

<p>Disk
evolution is usually studied by combining results from previous, but samples compiled in this way are very
heterogeneous, which can produce some biases. To overcome this issue, we compiled the largest sample of nearby
young stars in 22 star-forming regions and gathered data from different surveys and catalogs covering from optical
to mid-infrared wavelengths. After several homogenizing steps, we derived accurate disk fractions for all these
regions by analyzing infrared excesses produced by disk around stars. We confirmed that protoplanetary disks
disperse in less than 10 million years, and found evidence of the disk clearing occurring from inside out. These
results were presented in <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014A%26A...561A..54R">Ribas et al. 2014</a>.</p>
<p>The evolution of protoplanetary disks may also depend on factors other than simply time.  A good example is
the host star of the disk: the strong radiation fields and stellar winds around high-mass stars could disperse
circumstellar disks faster than in the case of the low-mass stars. If this is the case, then the planets around
high-mass and low-mass stars may have different properties. Using the large sample of young stars mentioned before,
we found statistically evidence for a faster dispersal of protoplanetary disks around massive stars (<a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A%26A...576A..52R">Ribas et al. 2015</a>).</p>
<table class="image" style="width:65%;" align="center"> <caption

and age (Ribas et al. 2015).</caption> <tr><td><a href = "../images/piecharts_evolved.png"><img

<p>More recently, we expanded the wavelength coverage of our dataset up to millimeter wavelengths for three of the
most studied star-forming regions in our sample: Taurus, Chamaeleon I, and Ophiuchus. Long wavelengths can be used
to study the size and properties of dust particles in protoplanetary disks (the initial stages of planet
formation), and we found that most sources in the sample showed some signatures of dust grain growth even at just 1
million years (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...849...63R/abstract">Ribas et al. 2017</a>). We are
currently working to apply detailed physical models of protoplanetary disks to this sample using machine learning
techniques, which will give us a unique look at some of their&nbsp;properties.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Transitional disks in Chamaeleon as seen by&nbsp;Herschel</h2>
<p>Transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with gaps and cavities in them. They are extremely interesting because
these gaps could be carved by newborn planets, and hence may be the perfect scenario to study in-situ planet
formation or even detect planetary&nbsp;embryos.</p>
<table class="image" style="width:50%; float:right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;" > <caption
align="bottom" style="font-size:14pt; font-style: italic">The Chamaeleon-I star-forming region, as seen in the far

href = "../images/chaI_plot_large.png"><img src="../images/chaI_plot.png" width = 100% /></a></td></tr> </table>

<p>Part of my research has focused on studying transitional disks with the Herschel Space Observatory. Herschel
covered the far-infrared part of the spectrum (from 70 to 500 microns) and probed the emission from the cold, outer
regions of disks. In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...552A.115R">Ribas et al. 2013</a>, we analyzed Herschel
observations of transitional disks in the Chamaeleon-I star-forming region and showed the potential of these data
to identify transitional sources. We also found hints of the transitional disks in this regions being brighter in
the far-infrared than protoplanetary sources, which could point to more exposed disk walls because of cavities, or
even some piling-up of mass caused by the gravitational influence of&nbsp;planets.</p>
<p>To further investigate what these new data can tell us about transitional disks, we studied them using disk models
and statistics tools. We found that Herschel data can improve our knowledge of the structure and mass of these
disks (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.458.1029R">Ribas et al. 2016</a>).</p>

<h2>Searching for warm debris disks around transiting planets&nbsp;systems</h2>
<p>Debris disks are the remnant of planet formation, and can be found around older stars. They are similar to our
Kuiper belt, consisting mainly of asteroids, planetesimals, and cold dust located far from their host star (several
tens of astronomical units). Because they are that cold, they emit in the far infrared regime. However, a small
fraction of these disks are detected in the mid infrared, meaning that their components are hotter (and hence
closer to their star) than typical debris disks. These &#8220;warm&#8221; debris disks are exciting, because they could be
produced by collisions of bodies in the inner regions of the system. Even more interesting, these collisions could be the result of the dynamical excitation of an asteroid belt
analog by planets in these&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A..38R">Ribas et al. 2012</a> we searched for warm debris disks
around all the known stars with transiting planets, plus the planetary systems candidates from the Kepler
mission. By including mid infrared data from the <span class="caps">WISE</span> survey, we identified 13 stars with promising mid infrared
excess at 12 and/or 22 microns and compared the estimated location of the dust with the orbits of the
planets/planetary candidates in these&nbsp;systems.</p>
