    <p>My research focusses on the disks of gas and dust that are found around newborn stars. Planets form in these disks,
so their characteristics are crucial to understand the huge diversity of planets that we are starting to
discover. By studying these targets at different wavelengths and comparing them with physical models, we can learn
about their structure, evolution, and their connection with planetary formation. You can get a pretty good idea of
the type of research I do by taking a look at my
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/59sioyyu3qr9z1p/AlvaroRibas_PhDThesis.pdf?dl=0">PhD Thesis</a>.</p>
<p>I am also an unconditional fan of the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language and very interested in
Bayesian statistics, data mining and visualization, and machine learning&nbsp;techniques.</p>

<h4>- <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...576A..52R">The dependence of protoplanetary disks on stellar&nbsp;mass</a></h4>
<p>Protoplanetary disks are known to evolve and disappear with time, in
less than or about 10 million years (see previous study). However,
their evolution may depend on factors others than simply time. A good
example is the host star of the disk: the strong radiation fields and
stellar winds around high-mass stars could disperse circumstellar
disks faster than in the case of the low-mass stars. If this is the
case, then the planets around high-mass and low-mass stars may have
different&nbsp;properties!</p>

<p>Using a large sample of young stellar objects in nearby star-forming
that I compiled through my PhD (see previous study), we have found
statistically robust evidence of protoplanetary disks evolving faster
around massive stars. Because planets form in these disks, this
difference may produce different exoplanetary populations around low-
and high-mass stars, and it may help explaining the apparent paucity
of hot Jupiters around massive&nbsp;stars.</p>

<h4>- <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...561A..54R">The evolution of protoplanetary disks in the solar&nbsp;neighborhood</a></h4>
<p>The evolution of protoplanetary disks is extremely
important: it determines the properties and fates of future
planetary systems. However, these disks last for millions of years,
and waiting that long is not practical (also, it is hard to find that
kind of long-term funding). The way to by-pass this problem is to look
at young star-forming regions in the sky with different ages. By
looking at the fraction of disks as a function of time, we can infer
how they&nbsp;evolve.</p>

<caption align="bottom">Disk fractions derived for
    each region as a function of age in Ribas et al. 2014. The red
    line shows the fit to the evolution of disks derived in our study
    (from Ribas et al. 2014).</caption>

<p>Different works have addressed this issue by combining previous studies
of diverse star-forming regions. However, samples compiled
in that way are very heterogeneous, and have different sensitivity and
completeness levels. Depending on the methods used, they may also
contain a significant number of background sources (i.e., not associated
with the region itself). As a consequence, their results may be biased
or suffer from important contamination&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>To overcome this issue, I compiled a large sample of young stars in 22
nearby and young star-forming regions. I then gathered data from
different surveys and catalogs, covering from the near-optical to the
mid-infrared for each object. After several quality checks and
homogenizing steps, the result is a large and consistent sample that
allowed us to derive accurate disk fractions for all these regions. We
did so by analyzing infrared excesses, due to the presence of disk
around stars. We robustly confirm that protoplanetary disks disperse
during the first 10 million years of their lives, and find evidence of
the disk clearing occurring from the inside&nbsp;out.</p>

Transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with signatures of gaps
and cavities in them. They are extremely interesting because these
gaps could be carved in the disks by newborn planets, and hence may be the perfect
scenario to study in-situ planet formation or even detect planetary&nbsp;embryos.</p>
<p>In
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...552A.115R">Identification of transitional disks in Chamaeleon with Herschel (Ribas et al. 2012, A&amp;A)</a>,
we used data from the
<a href="http://sci.esa.int/herschel/"><em>Herschel</em> Space Observatory</a> to study
transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I and <span class="caps">II</span> star-forming
regions. <em>Herschel</em> covered the far-infrared part of the spectrum
(from 70 to 500 microns) and probed the emission from the outer regions of
 disks. In this study, we showed the potential of these data to
 identify transitional objects among typical protoplanetary disks. We
 also found hints of the transitional disks in this regions being brighter in the
 far-infrared than protoplanetary sources, which could point to more
 exposed disk walls because of cavities, or even some piling-up of
 mass caused by the gravitational influence of&nbsp;planets.</p>

<h4>-<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A..38R">Searching for warm debris disks around transiting planets&nbsp;systems</a></h4>
<p>Not every disk around a star is a protoplanetary one. Debris disks are
the remnant of planet formation, and can be found in much
older systems. They are similar to out Kuiper belt, consisting mainly
of asteroids, planetesimals, and cold dust located far from their host
star (several tens of astronomical units). Because they are that cold,
they emit in the far infrared&nbsp;regime.</p>
<p>However, there is a small fraction of these disks which are detected
in the mid infrared, meaning they their components are hotter, and
hence closer to their star, than in typical debris disks. These &#8220;warm&#8221;
debris disks are exciting, because in principle they should not exist:
dust located in close proximity of stars would be either engulfed or
pushed away. Therefore, these disks may be transient in nature: a
collision of two bodies in the inner regions of a stellar system would
refill it with dust for some time, which we will detect as mid
infrared emission in them. And even better, such collisions could be
produced by the dynamical excitation of an asteroid belt analog by
planets in these&nbsp;systems!</p>
<p>In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0013v1.pdf">Warm debris disks candidates in transiting planets systems (Ribas et al. 2012, A&amp;A)</a>,
we searched for these warm debris disks around all the known stars
with transiting planets, plus all the planetary systems candidates
from the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler</a> mission. By including mid
infrared data from the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/wise/"><span class="caps">WISE</span></a>
telescope, we identified 13 stars with promising mid infrared excess
at 12 and/or 22 microns and compared the estimated location of the
dust with the orbits of the planets/planetary candidates in these&nbsp;systems.</p>
